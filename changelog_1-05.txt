1.05~alpha
- added artwork.dump addonseetings item in settings window (matrix only)

- improved autoplay trailer behaviour for home menu 
	->	still an 'experimental feature and will alwas be 
		due to refreshing widget container if playable media start playing,stop playing
	-> if not spotlight home layout is in use , there is an option to use a big preview window which opens after 5 sec
	   or you can show a tiny preview windoe in the corresponding widget row


	-> in generell at current state not recommended if using android touch device  -> touch input dont count as input
	  maybe i switch to other usage to prevent this
- code cleanup
